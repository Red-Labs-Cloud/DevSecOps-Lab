The lab serves as a practical environment for learning, experimenting, and demonstrating the integration of security into every stage of the software development lifecycle.


## Key Objectives

- Demonstrate a secure CI/CD pipeline: Implement a robust and automated pipeline that incorporates security checks at each step, from code commit to deployment.
- Showcase security scanning and analysis: Integrate various security tools to perform static and dynamic code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and dependency checks.
- Implement Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with security best practices: Utilize IaC tools like Terraform to provision and manage secure infrastructure in the cloud.
- Promote a culture of shared responsibility for security: Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing between development, security, and operations teams.


## Expected Outcomes

- A fully functional DevSecOps pipeline with integrated security tools.
- Secure and reliable infrastructure deployed using IaC.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for learning and implementation.
- A collaborative environment for continuous improvement and innovation in DevSecOps practices.

This project is an ongoing initiative, and we encourage contributions from the community to enhance its value and relevance. Join us in building a robust and secure DevSecOps Lab!
